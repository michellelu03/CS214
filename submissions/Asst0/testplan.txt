We tested our code by using large scale csv generators. Running both insertion and quicksort and comparing
the results.

For integer testing, we specifically tried all negative numbers, positive numbers and a mix of both.
This was mainly in order to test for proper recognization of negative numbers

String testing was done on various length strings, not as many possible edge cases here, so
the purpose was just making sure that the list of alphabetized.

large data sets up to 200 tokens were used, and empty tokens were included. Ending on a comma would not
create an empty token as per instructions.
